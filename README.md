## 💭 Who is Yuna?

Yuna is a 23-year-old who travels the world in a soft, cream-colored mascot costume named **Mochi**.

She gives free hugs to strangers — because sometimes, that's all someone needs.

She doesn't show her face. Just Mochi's gentle smile, open arms, and the quiet belief that small acts of warmth can change someone's day.
